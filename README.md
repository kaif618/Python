# PyPassword Generator 🔒  

A simple Python script to generate a random password with user-specified numbers of letters, symbols, and digits.

## 🚀 Features

- Ensures characters are **shuffled** to avoid predictable patterns.
- Allows the user to specify the number of each type of character.
- Easy-to-use **command-line interface**.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The script asks the user for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.
2. It randomly selects characters based on the input.
3. It shuffles the selected characters to ensure randomness.
4. The final password is displayed on the screen.

## 📜 Usage
Run the script using Python:
```sh
python password_generator.py

📌Notes
1. Each password is unique and randomly generated.
2. If you prefer a longer or shorter password, just change the input values when prompted.
3. This script does not store or save passwords for security reasons.
